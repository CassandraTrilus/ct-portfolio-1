Featuring personal profiles, favorites lists, and a Google Places integration, users can search for pet-friendly businesses on a live-updated map and filter by pet type and size. Users can save their favorites, see details and user reviews, and even submit their own reviews about their pet-friendly experiences. I acted as a developer and the design lead for this project and I came up with the concept, the UI, and some of the feature designs for the group.'

      - Created a new object schema for coupons, added an Express endpoint to add coupon codes to the database, added another endpoint to verify the existence of the coupon code, created a user input component to allow them to apply the promo code, and created a reducer action that applied the discount to all items in the cart
      - Created a custom hook, reducer, and context to allow the user to set the currency (switch between USD ($) and Euro (â‚¬)), and have the price values update accordingly
      - Added localstorage to the shopping cart so that the state of the cart would be saved across browser sessions
      - Updated the database to store order information and modified the UI to display an order ID number upon order confirmation.'
